# Space robot (planar case)
This is a simulation tool to simulate a planar space robot which is a 3DoF free-floating satellite equipped with a 3DoF robotic arm (space-robot-control-torques.ipynb). Files related to the use of Twin delayed DDPG (TD3) for planning the motion of a space manipulator will be added on a regular basis. 

The parameters used in this simulation tool are the same parameters as those of the space robot at the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences. More information about this space robot and the microgravity testbed can be found in our paper:
